# TomHoll

Tomholl is the "Raftergram" frontend implemented with NextJS.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Running locally

First, you need to have the repository in your machine. You can clone the project to achieve this:

```
https://github.com/rafateruya/tomholl
```

After this, install the dependencies with yarn:

yarn install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop new components and pages and check the states without needing to interact the application and doing complex stuff to get in the desired state.
To run storybook, run:

```
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.
